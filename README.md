# Excursion Codecademy Project

## Thoughts on the project

So far codecademy has done a good job walking me through
front end development. This project gave us the assets needed to complete 
the project and an example of the end goal. Our job was then to recreate the
site without help. I had to use google a few times to learn how to do something
but I am proud that I was able to accomplish this mission.
